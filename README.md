# UtilityBox

UtilityBox is a collection of Javascript and CSS helpers, tricks, and what-not's implemented
by [Digital Opera](http://www.digitalopera.com).  Each feature built here has been used by us
at some point in time in realworld projects.  We wanted to put those "nuggets" someplace where
we could more easily pull them into new projects.

We hope that you find it as useful and helpful as we do.

## Installation
